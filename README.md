# voting_system 
This is a voting system designed for coworkers to vote on each other's characteristics in various categories. The system allows users to vote, track the votes, view results for each category, and generate PDF certificates for the winners. While the system is intended to restrict PDF generation to the actual winners, due to time constraints, there are no restrictions, and anyone can generate the PDF for the winners.
